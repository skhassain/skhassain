At NxtWave’s CCBP 4.0 Intensive, I’m currently learning fullstack development with a specialization in 4.0 technologies. In love with the coding challenges and hands-on projects. With Industry’s first ever IRC 4.0, getting ready to take on new challenges in the tech world.
 Core strengths include Coding, JavaScript, Python, React Js, etc. I'm a quick learner and I have very good problem-solving skills.
